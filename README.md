Here's an overview of the model architecture:

Input Layer
LSTM Layers (with adjustable units)
Output Layer with Softmax Activation
Training with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
Dataset
The LSTM model is trained on a large and diverse text corpus. If you wish to use a different dataset, you can replace the training data according to your requirements.
