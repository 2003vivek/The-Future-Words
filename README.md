Overview
The Next Word Predictor with LSTM Neural Network is built to provide accurate and efficient word predictions based on the context of the previous words in a sentence or text. This project aims to help developers integrate advanced text prediction capabilities into their applications.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/next-word-predictor.git
Install the required dependencies:scikit-learn,tensorflow,nltk,etc. Please refer to the project imports  for more...

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the Next Word Predictor, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the project.

Load the pre-trained LSTM model using your preferred method.

Input a sequence of words or a sentence to predict the next word.

Obtain the predicted word or a list of suggestions based on the context.

Model Architecture
The Next Word Predictor project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for its prediction tasks. The LSTM architecture is well-suited for handling sequential data and capturing long-range dependencies in the input text.

Here's an overview of the model architecture:

Input Layer
LSTM Layers (with adjustable units)
Output Layer with Softmax Activation
Training with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
Dataset
The LSTM model is trained on a large and diverse text corpus. If you wish to use a different dataset, you can replace the training data according to your requirements.
